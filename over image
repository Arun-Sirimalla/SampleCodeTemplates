<span class="ms-rteThemeForeColor-5-0" style="text-decoration: underline;">Executive Order #66</span> requires all cabinet agencies to participate in a statewide &quot;<a href="https://lean.wi.gov/Pages/home.aspx" style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="ms-rteThemeForeColor-5-0" style="text-decoration: underline;">Lean Government Program</span></a>.&quot; Since July 2012, the department has&#160;demonstrated its commitment&#160;to this order through projects aimed at improving customer service, maximizing efficient operations, cost savings, streamlining processes and making informed data-driven decisions. In coordination with the Department of Administration (DOA),&#160;WisDOT reports annually to the Governor’s Office on progress toward meeting the mandate.
